### Personal info
I'm a student of rs-school, and my goal is to be a professional frontent developer.
My strengths include the fact, that I'm a fast learner, self-disciplined and self-aware person. I trained in Epam as a QA Automation Engineer for a 9 month. While of this internship, I used to write autotests using Java. Then I have decided to switch to a web development and develop in this area.
